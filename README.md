Liri is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while siri is a speech interpretation and recognition interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes paramaters and gives back date. 

Liri will display the latest tweets, send request to Spotify and OMDB Api.
